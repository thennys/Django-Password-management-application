 
 PROJECT :
 
Creating a website to securely store and manage passwords can be a valuable project idea. To implement this using Django, you can follow these steps:

Set up a Django project: Install Django and create a new project using the command line.

1.   Design the database model: Define a database model to store the necessary information.

2.  Implement user registration and authentication.

3. Create password encryption algorithm: Design and implement an encryption algorithm to encode passwords securely.

4. Build password management functionality: Implement the necessary views and forms to allow users to add, update, and delete password entries.

5. Implement password retrieval and display: Provide functionality for users to retrieve and display their passwords. This can involve decrypting the stored passwords using the encryption algorithm implemented earlier.

6. Enhance security measures: Implement additional security measures to protect user data. For example, you can enforce strong password policies, use HTTPS for secure communication, and add features like two-factor authentication or account recovery options.
